  1. RandomForest: Directly convert into code
  2. Linear regression: one hot encoding
### Missing data
  We drop the data which has empty value because there are at least 7000000x52 data in the dataset, which doesnâ€™t affect the result a lot. Moreover, for the price part, we fill the mean of price.
